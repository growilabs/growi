# Learned Skills Directory

This directory contains Skills learned from development sessions using the `/learn` command.

Each learned skill is automatically applied when working on related code based on its description.

## Structure

```
learned/
├── {topic-name-1}/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── {topic-name-2}/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── {topic-name-3}/
    └── SKILL.md
```

## How Skills Are Created

Use the `/learn` command after completing a feature or solving a complex problem:

```
/learn
```

Claude will extract reusable patterns and save them as Skills in this directory.
